# Stack Tracker Pro - Features Update

## Summary of Changes

This update adds significant new features to Stack Tracker Pro, including multi-item receipt scanning, spreadsheet import functionality, and usage limits for the free tier.

---

## 1. Multi-Item Receipt Scanning

### What Changed
- **Backend AI Enhancement**: The Claude Vision API now extracts ALL items from a single receipt
- **Support for Mixed Receipts**: Can now handle receipts containing both Silver AND Gold purchases
- **Automatic Separation**: Each item is automatically added to the correct holdings (Silver/Gold)

### How It Works
1. User scans a receipt that contains multiple items
2. Claude AI extracts all line items from the receipt:
   - Dealer name (shared across all items)
   - Purchase date (shared across all items)
   - Individual item details (metal type, product name, quantity, price, weight)
3. App creates separate holdings for each item
4. Shows summary: "Found 3 items: 2 Silver, 1 Gold"

### Technical Details
- **Backend**: `backend/server.js` (lines 474-547)
  - Updated prompt to extract items array instead of single item
  - New response format:
    ```json
    {
      "dealer": "APMEX",
      "purchaseDate": "2025-12-25",
      "items": [
        {
          "metal": "silver",
          "description": "American Silver Eagle",
          "quantity": 10,
          "ozt": 1,
          "unitPrice": 35.50
        },
        {
          "metal": "gold",
          "description": "Canadian Maple Leaf 1oz",
          "quantity": 1,
          "ozt": 1,
          "unitPrice": 2400.00
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

- **Mobile App**: `mobile-app/App.js` (lines 614-706)
  - Loops through all items in response
  - Gets historical spot price for each item
  - Calculates premium per item
  - Adds each item to appropriate holdings array
  - Sets metal tab to "both" if mixed metals detected

### User Experience
- Scans one receipt → automatically creates multiple holdings
- No manual entry required for each item
- Summary message shows what was found
- Modal auto-closes after 2 seconds on success

---

## 2. Spreadsheet Import Feature

### What Changed
- **New Import Button**: Added "Import from Spreadsheet" button to Holdings screen
- **CSV & Excel Support**: Accepts .csv, .xls, and .xlsx files
- **Flexible Column Mapping**: Auto-detects common column names
- **Preview Before Import**: Shows what will be imported before confirming
- **Bulk Import**: Add hundreds of items at once

### How It Works
1. User taps "Import from Spreadsheet" button on Holdings screen
2. Selects a CSV or Excel file from their device
3. App parses the file and maps columns automatically:
   - **Product Name**: product, name, item, description
   - **Metal Type**: metal, type (must contain "gold" or "silver")
   - **Quantity**: quantity, qty, count, amount
   - **Unit Price**: price, unit price, cost, unit cost
   - **Date**: date, purchased, purchase date, order date
   - **Dealer**: dealer, source, vendor, seller
   - **OZT**: oz, ozt, ounces, troy oz, weight
4. Shows preview of first 10 items
5. User confirms → all items imported

### Required Columns
- **Product Name** (required)
- **Metal Type** (required - must be "gold" or "silver")
- All other columns are optional (defaults: quantity=1, ozt=1, price=0)

### Example Spreadsheet Format

| Product Name | Metal Type | Quantity | Unit Price | OZT | Date | Dealer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| American Silver Eagle | Silver | 10 | 35.50 | 1 | 2025-12-20 | APMEX |
| Canadian Maple Leaf | Gold | 1 | 2400 | 1 | 2025-12-15 | JM Bullion |
| Mercury Dime Roll | Silver | 50 | 4.25 | 0.07234 | 2025-11-10 | Local Coin Shop |

### Technical Details
- **Library Used**: `xlsx` (npm package)
- **Parsing**: `mobile-app/App.js` (lines 765-875)
  - Reads file as base64
  - Converts to Uint8Array
  - Parses with XLSX.read()
  - Flexible column detection with fuzzy matching
  - Validates required columns exist
  - Skips rows with missing essential data

- **File Types Supported**:
  - `.csv` - Comma-separated values
  - `.xls` - Excel 97-2003
  - `.xlsx` - Excel 2007+

### User Experience
- One-click bulk import

## 4. Receipt Scan Limits

### What Changed
- **Free Tier Limits**: 5 scans total (photos OR spreadsheets)
- **Gold Tier**: Unlimited scans
- **Usage Tracking**: Scan count persisted in AsyncStorage
- **Clear Messaging**: Shows remaining scans in UI

### How It Works

#### Free Tier
- 5 total scans included
- **Each photo scan = 1 scan**
- **Each spreadsheet import = 1 scan** (regardless of how many rows)
- Scan counter shown in Add/Edit modal
- When limit reached, shows upgrade prompt

#### Gold Tier
- Unlimited scans
- No tracking needed
- UI shows: "✓ Unlimited scans with Gold"

### Scan Count Display
- **Add/Edit Modal** (under AI Receipt Scanner):
  - Free tier: "Scans used: 3/5"
  - Limit reached: "Scan limit reached. Upgrade to Gold for unlimited!"
  - Gold tier: "✓ Unlimited scans with Gold"

### Technical Details
- **State**: `mobile-app/App.js` (line 203-204)
  ```javascript
  const [scanCount, setScanCount] = useState(0);
  const FREE_SCAN_LIMIT = 5;
  ```

- **Persistence**: AsyncStorage key `stack_scan_count`

- **Check Before Scan**: Lines 463-479
  ```javascript
  const checkScanLimit = () => {
    if (hasGold) return true; // Gold tier bypass

    if (scanCount >= FREE_SCAN_LIMIT) {
      Alert.alert(
        'Scan Limit Reached',
        'Free tier includes 5 scans...',
        [
          { text: 'Maybe Later', style: 'cancel' },
          { text: 'Upgrade to Gold', onPress: () => setShowPaywallModal(true) }
        ]
      );
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  };
  ```

- **Increment on Use**: Lines 452-456
  - Called in `scanReceipt()` (line 635)
  - Called in `importSpreadsheet()` (line 778)

### User Experience
- Always know how many scans remaining
- Clear upgrade path when limit reached
- Fair usage: 1 spreadsheet = 1 scan (even if it has 100 rows)
- No hidden limits or surprises

## API Changes

### Receipt Scanning Endpoint (`POST /api/scan-receipt`)

**Previous Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "dealer": "APMEX",
  "purchaseDate": "2025-12-25",
  "metal": "silver",
  "description": "American Silver Eagle",
  "quantity": 10,
  "ozt": 1,
  "unitPrice": 35.50
}
```

**New Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "dealer": "APMEX",
  "purchaseDate": "2025-12-25",
  "items": [
    {
      "metal": "silver",
      "description": "American Silver Eagle",
      "quantity": 10,
      "ozt": 1,
      "unitPrice": 35.50
    },
    {
      "metal": "gold",
      "description": "1oz Gold Bar",
      "quantity": 1,
      "ozt": 1,
      "unitPrice": 2400
    }
  ],
  "itemCount": 2,
  "privacyNote": "Image processed in memory and immediately discarded"
}
```

**Breaking Change**: Yes, but mobile app handles both formats gracefully

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Spreadsheet Import**:
   - Only processes first sheet in multi-sheet workbooks
   - Requires "Product Name" and "Metal Type" columns
   - Skips rows with missing essential data
   - Metal type must contain "gold" or "silver" (case-insensitive)

2. **Receipt Scanning**:
   - Accuracy depends on receipt quality/format
   - May not extract all fields from unusual receipt formats
   - Currently supports English text only

3. **Scan Limit**:
   - No way to reset scan count without reinstalling app
   - Scan count tied to device, not account (local-only app)

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Spreadsheet Export**: Export holdings to CSV/Excel format
2. **Template Download**: Provide example spreadsheet template for import
3. **Multi-Sheet Support**: Import from specific sheet in workbook
4. **Scan Count Reset**: Allow manual reset once per month
5. **Receipt History**: Keep history of scanned receipts (opt-in)

---

## Support

### User Questions

**Q: Why does a spreadsheet with 100 rows only count as 1 scan?**
A: We believe this is fair usage. You're using AI once to process the file, so it counts as one scan - regardless of how many items are in it.

**Q: Can I reset my scan count?**
A: Currently no. The scan count is tied to your device. If you upgrade to Gold, you get unlimited scans.

**Q: What if my receipt has 10 items but AI only finds 8?**
A: You can manually add the missing 2 items. AI scanning is a convenience feature - you can always add items manually.

**Q: Why did Lifetime price increase?**
A: The app now includes significantly more features (multi-item scanning, spreadsheet import, unlimited scans for Gold). The $79.99 lifetime price better reflects the value provided.

**Q: Do scan limits apply to manual entry?**
A: No! Manual entry is always unlimited, even on free tier. Scan limits only apply to AI-powered receipt scanning and spreadsheet imports.
