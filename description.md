### One-Liner
Stack Tracker Pro is a privacy-first precious metals portfolio tracker with AI receipt scanning that keeps all your data on your device.

### Elevator Pitch
Precious metals stackers are privacy-conscious by nature, yet most portfolio apps want your data. Stack Tracker Pro flips the script – we built an app where your holdings data never leaves your device. Our AI receipt scanner processes images in memory and immediately deletes them. We don't have accounts, we don't track users, and we architected the system so we literally CAN'T see what you own. It's the tracker stackers have been waiting for.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Zero data collection** – We don't even have a database for user data
2. **Memory-only receipt processing** – Images never touch disk
3. **No accounts** – Start using immediately, no sign-up required
4. **Open architecture** – Privacy documentation publicly available
5. **Built for stackers** – Features designed by precious metals enthusiasts
